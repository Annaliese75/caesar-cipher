Ceasar Cipher (Tkinter Interface)

So this is the first version of a basic cipher app using the Ceasar Cipher
and Python, written and tested on a Macbook M3 with Python 3.13.

This is just a bit of fun for me while I am learning Python, there is 
still work I need to complete with error catching and a few other things
that I need to complete.

This project is not meant to be a serious cryptography application as
Ceasar Cipher is easily cracked so please don't use this to send 
anything that needs actual security!

Release under the BSD license, and the orignial encryption code was 
created and released by No Starch Press under the BSD license, modified
by myself for this project.
